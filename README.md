In this analysis, I began by importing the dataset and conducting an initial overview, examining its structure and basic statistics. Moving on to univariate analysis, I explored the distributions of numerical variables through histograms and boxplots, identifying outliers and examining their impact, while also visualizing the frequency distributions of categorical variables using countplots. Bivariate analysis followed, where I investigated relationships between numerical variables through correlation coefficients and scatter plots, and examined patterns between categorical and numerical variables using boxplots and barplots. Additionally, I explored relationships between categorical variables using contingency tables and stacked bar plots. Research questions were addressed regarding fresh graduate salaries in specific roles and the relationship between gender and specialization preferences. Finally, conclusions were drawn based on the analysis findings, and suggestions for further exploration were provided, along with potential research questions for future investigation.
